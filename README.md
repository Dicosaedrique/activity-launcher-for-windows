# :gem: Fast Workspace :gem: 

## TL;DR
Launch a group of applications in just one click, create a workspace for each of your projects to be able to switch from one to the other quickly!

## Goal and motivation :fire:
A small project that I hope to make available quickly as a personal side project. It's supposed to allow you to manage multiple workspaces, a workspace would be a group of application, software, etc that you would consider as part of a workspace. You would then be able to launch this workspace so that every application and tasks would execute quickly or setting up to launch at startup of your machine.

------------

The idea behind it is to make it easier to switch between project either personal or professional ones. In my job I often need to open the same things every day (browser, visual studio, studio code, command terminal, ...) and would benefit from having an app that centralize this behavior and make it possible to manage multiple bundle of behavior so that if I need to lunch another project I can just click on button in this app and everything would launch.

## Technology
The application would be developped using the [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui) platform. It would be available for Windows and downloadable from this GitHub page.

## Project
This is a small project to try a first app using [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui) and is not intended to be really complex nor long term maintained. The project is open source and free to use, feel free to download and use it or to fork it and develop it on your own. If you feel like it, you can also open a pull request to add new features that you'd like to see in it.

## Todo

### Setup
- [ ] Setup project with MAUI and Blazor
- [ ] Add MudBlazor to the project

### Very Minimum Viable Product
- [ ] Statically start the app when clicking on a button

### Nice to have
- [ ] Publish the application
- [ ] Build the application on new main commit and publish it to GitHub
